# Stocks Analyzer

Stocks Analyzer calculates profits, dollar cost averages, and unreckognized profits from transactions history of stocks & crypto currencies. Currently the application only works for crypto currencies. The application applies each sell to the oldest unsold buy transaction to calculate the results. Finally, the application has an import/export functionality to save results.

## Future

In the future, the application could include dashboards, graphs, and filters for further analysis and prediction capabalities.
